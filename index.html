          Nick and Katie met in highschool in 2011. Nick was a sophomore and Katie was a Junior. The two were introduced by a mutual friend, Jon Lee. After a year of texting, hanging out during lunch, and hugs between classes, on Tuesday October 16,
          2012, Nick finally got up the nerve to ask Katie to dinner. He was so nervous he asked her during a hug so he wouldn’t see her face if she said no. The spark lit instantaneously! Katie was so happy she sealed the deal with a kiss. From that
          day on, Katie knew he was the one. The cute, shy, innocent Nick was finally hers!
        </p>
        <p class="where-it-all-started-text">
          Katie soon realized there was way more to Nick. He can make her laugh on her worst days without even trying. Every day is an adventure, but there’s no one else Katie would rather be on this adventure called life with. Over the past years
          the
          two have survived highschool, college, and moved into their first apartment together. Now they are ready for their next chapter!
        </p>
        <p class="where-it-all-started-text">
          On Friday, March 13, 2020, Nick surprised Katie with a secret reservation at Signature Grill at Starr Pass. This was the place they had danced all night during Katie’s senior prom. They got dressed up and right as they were about to leave
          to
          the restaurant, Nick pulled out a ring and got down on one knee. Katie tried to act suprised, but secretly, she knew it was coming. It was about dang time!
        </p>
        <p class="where-it-all-started-text">
          Katie and Nick have been together for 8 years now and will be saying “I do” on their 9 year anniversary. They invite you all, family and friends, to join them in celebration as they solidify their love.
